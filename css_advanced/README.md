#SmileSchool

SmileSchool is a fun and interactive website that teaches people how to smile with confidence. Our knowledgeable instructors make sure that everyone may smile with happiness during our lectures.

## Project Synopsis

In order to create a user-friendly interface, HTML and CSS will be used to create a website for SmileSchool. The website is divided into several areas, such as those for courses, costs, login, reviews, and frequently asked questions (FAQ).

### Structure of HTML

- The website's primary structure is contained in the `index.html` file.
- The navigation bar in the header has links to the pages for the course, prices, and login.
- There are multiple subsections within the main section:
  - Introduction: A salutation featuring a button for action.
  - Learn from the Experts: Including well-known grin specialists.
  - Testimonials: Displaying comments from users.
  - The Most Followed Tutorials
  - No Cost to Join
  - FAQ: Providing responses to frequently asked queries.

### Pictures

- The HTML references the images via relative paths, which are kept in the `images` folder.
To ensure proper presentation, make sure the photos are in the right directory.
